# bitwig-extensions/.../studiologic

Just a fork for Bitwig and SL Mixface controller users. It contains:

* The sl-mixface.bwextension file needed to enable Bitwig integration for the SL Mixface controller. https://github.com/quimgil/bitwig-extensions-studiologic/raw/main/target/SLMixface.bwextension
  * IMPORTANT! Set the DAW to "REASON" in your controller.
* The two extension source code files found at https://github.com/bitwig/bitwig-extensions/tree/api-13/src/main/java/com/bitwig/extensions/controllers/studiologic (with the minimum customization to run as a standalone extension).
* The little glue needed to build the script from the source code.
